Lecture4-ER Model
1. entity
E/R Diagrams
instance of an entity set

2.relationships
for example: Bars sells Beers, Drinkers like Beers, Bars frequents Drinkers. (can create 6-7 tables)
how many tables depends on -- arrow head... relationshps
instance of a relationship
a relationship R between sets E and F, relates some entities in E to some entities in F.
such as: Students take a Course, get (grade-relationship)

relationship set: means relationship is a table, 
                  the value of the relationship                 
such as: Sells
Bar           Beer
one           beer1
one           beer2
one           beer3

(important) Multiplicity of a Binary Relationship
many to many (0-many choose 0-many)
one to many  (0-1 choose 0-many)
one to one   (0-1 choose 0-1)

open arrows express exictly one (another set can be 0 to many)
such as: manfs only have one best-seller is Beers.

3.attribute
primite key is unic

recall: how to indentify relationships: given two set, use sell

roles in relationships:

relationship to itself
such as: preReq requirement courses, courses requirer preReq

roles: 
such as: Drinkers have husband and wife which are married

parallel relationships:
such as: students take coursees
          students TA courses
          
multiple relationships:
for example: 3-way relationship
             for example: 
                          one person only drink one beer in one bar.
                          one person only buy beef in Costco.
             4-way relationship
             for example:
                          
A relation is a table
schemas: relation name and attribute list
database: collection of relations
database schemas: set relations

single quote '' means String value
TIME 'hh.mm.ss' -- followed format

a table can have one primavite key, and can't be NULL
but can have many UNIQUE key, and can be NULL
